# Scuffed Fuel Estimator
Do you want to find out what is the equivalent of your lasting fuel in you car in euros ? How much your next refuel will cost ? You're at the good repository.

# What is it exactly ?
Like the name of this repository says, this is a (very very) scuffed fuel estimator made by me in Python. It currently have three functionalities :

- Can predict how much did your last refuel cost depending on the type of fuel you used.
- Can predict how much will your next refuel cost depending on the type of fuel you use.
- Can tell you how much fuel you have left in euros.

The data used for this is from https://carbu.com/france/prixmoyens.
Modules used are 'Beautiful Soup' and the built-in 'requests' for extracting the data.

# Why making this ?
I've been learning Python for about a month now (November 2020) and I decided that it is now time for my first project ever. 
I made this project trying to use very minimal help from the internet (excepct for finding, well you know, a good data to scrap).
Using GitHub to store my projects will also help me learning the platform which is a very good point.
Finally, updates of this code may happen soon.
